// Description: 
// This program calculates the total cost for a service job based on user inputs.
// It prompts the user for their name, the hours of labor, and the cost of parts.
// The program then computes the labor total (using a fixed rate), sales tax, and the overall total cost.
// Finally, it displays a summary including the user's name, labor cost, parts cost, sales tax, and total cost.
